# Namore Custom

## Notable Formulae

### CalculiX for MacOS

Forked and updated, you can install CalculiX on any modern MacOS (even with M1 chip).
I use it successfully for FEM simulations with FreeCAD on MacOS.

Installation is very simple:

    brew install namore/homebrew-custom/namore-calculix-ccx

Then select the following Path under FreeCAD settings / FEM / CalculiX / cxx binary path::

    /opt/homebrew/bin/ccx_2.17

## General instructions: How do I install these formulae?

`brew install namore/custom/<formula>`

Or `brew tap namore/custom` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
